### The Game
The ever peaceful sky lands of Tygardia are being threatened by a destructive meteor. This meteor can only be destroyed by activating an ancient beacon, guarded by monsters and puzzles. Can you prevent this mysterious catastrophe from happening? <br>

Shard of Kronos is a third-person adventure game where you need to save the world by solving various puzzles using your bow and arrow and a vision-enhancing ability. You follow the story of Eden Siegfried, a young, talented, and an exceptionally skilled archer. <br> 

This final build is the result of 14 weeks where 15 different specialized students worked together to create a fully functioning 3D game. <br> <br>

### How we did it
We started this project on 12 oktober 2020 and ended it around 28 januari 2021. This means this project was created and finnished during the Corona Pandemic. Me and a group of 14 other students, all of different disciplinaries, chose to do this Minor: The Game Minor of Hogeschool Rotterdam. We did this by using Discord and creating a hyrarchy within our group. We had 3 teams: The Developer Team, The Artist Team and The Designer Team. Every one of these teams had a lead that they all had to refer to. In turn the leads communicate (with the by us chosen) Project Manager. Who in turn notifies our process to our teachers. <br> <br>

### What about me?
I first started out as a Developer for this group. I *thought* I already knew the basics of Unity because of my past project: "Anemianiac". I was mistaken. Working on this project was completely different than anything I was every used to. I had to work on it everday from 10 to 5, with a team of four other remarkable programmers. I had to understand their code and modify it while learning knew knowledge about Unity so I could keep up with the rest of the team. <br>

I also had an interest in learning how to 3D model. So early on till halfway into the project I also did a little bit of Artist work: I made a tree! I did this by joining the Art-Team on fridays for a while. <br>

Both positions where exhilarating and at times extremely fun. And at the end, when it was *finally* finished, it also felt very rewarding.  <br><br>
